# Scoobydoo Memory Match

## **Overview**

Scoobydoo Memory match is an 18 card game where the player has to creect match the characters. But this game comes with a twist where you're supposed to only match the cast of Scooby Doo
to enable the mystery artist. Added special feature for when they match the clue card, a track is played to give a hint on who the artist is, this is all done by getting information from the spotify api. The technologies I've used for this game are HTML5, CSS3, Responsive Design, Javascript, Ajax.

## **Features I want to add**

* Timer
* Coding done in Object Oriented Programming
